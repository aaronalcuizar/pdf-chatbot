**Design Decisions**

1. Architecture Choice

Decision: Modular architecture with separate utilities for PDF processing, embeddings, and LLM handling.

Rationale:

* Separation of concerns for maintainability
* Easy to test individual components
* Scalable for future enhancements
* Clean code organization

Implementation:

```
utils/
├── pdf_processor.py      PDF text extraction and chunking
├── embeddings.py         Vector embeddings and similarity search
└── llm_handler.py        ChatGPT API integration
```

2. PDF Processing Strategy

Decision: Use PyMuPDF (fitz) for PDF text extraction with intelligent chunking.

Rationale:

* Reliable text extraction across different PDF types
* Better performance than alternatives (pdfplumber, PyPDF2)
* Handles complex layouts and formatting
* Active maintenance and community support

Implementation Details:

* Chunk size: 800–1000 characters with 200-character overlap
* Text cleaning: Remove excessive whitespace and special characters
* Sentence-boundary aware chunking for better context preservation

3. Embedding Strategy

Decision: Hybrid approach with OpenAI embeddings (when API available) and text-based similarity search (fallback).

Rationale:

* Provides functionality even without API keys (demo mode)
* Cost-effective for development and testing
* Semantic search capability when full API is available
* Graceful degradation of features

Text-based Similarity Algorithm:

* Jaccard similarity for keyword overlap
* Substring matching for exact phrase detection
* Word match ratio for relevance scoring
* Combined scoring with configurable weights

4. User Interface Design

Decision: ChatGPT-style interface with sidebar controls.

Rationale:

* Familiar user experience (ChatGPT-like)
* Clear separation of controls and conversation
* Responsive design for various screen sizes
* Professional appearance for assessment submission

Key UI Elements:

* Chat bubbles with user/AI distinction
* Sidebar for document upload and settings
* Quick suggestion buttons
* Document status indicators
* Smooth animations and transitions

**Challenges Faced and Solutions**

Challenge 1: Session State Management

Problem: Streamlit's session state causing issues with chat history and input field clearing.

Solution Attempts:

1. Direct session state manipulation - caused recursion errors
2. Complex state tracking - led to synchronization issues
3. Final Solution: Simplified state management with unique keys and clean rerun logic

Implementation:

```
# Clean session state initialization
if 'messages' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.messages = []

# Proper input handling with unique keys
user_input = st.text_input("Message", key="chat_input")
```

Challenge 2: Large Document Processing

Problem: Memory issues and slow processing with large PDF files (40,000+ words)

Solutions Implemented:

* Chunking Strategy: Implemented overlapping text chunks to maintain context
* Progress Indicators: Added progress bars for user feedback
* Error Handling: Graceful degradation for problematic PDFs
* Memory Management: Process documents in chunks rather than loading entirely

Code Example:

```
def split_text_into_chunks(self, text: str, chunk_size: int = 1000, overlap: int = 200):
    # Implementation with sentence-boundary awareness
    # Prevents cutting sentences in half
    # Maintains context through overlap
```

Challenge 3: API Cost Management

Problem: Need to provide functionality without requiring expensive API calls for testing

Solution: Implemented intelligent demo mode that:

* Analyzes document content patterns
* Provides meaningful responses without API calls
* Detects document types automatically
* Suggests relevant questions based on content

Demo Mode Features:

* Document type detection (research, business, legal, etc.)
* Context-aware responses with extracted key information
* Dynamic question suggestions
* Professional presentation of analysis

Challenge 4: Cross-Platform Compatibility

Problem: Ensuring the application works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

Solutions:

* Used cross-platform libraries (PyMuPDF, Streamlit)
* Proper path handling with os.path
* Environment variable management with python-dotenv
* Clear installation instructions for all platforms

**Prompt Engineering Strategies**

1. Context-Aware Prompting

Strategy: Dynamic prompt generation based on document type and content

Implementation:

```
def create_system_prompt(self, context: str, doc_type: str):
    return f"""You are an intelligent document analyst specializing in {doc_type}.

    Analyze the following content and provide insights specific to this document type:
    - Research papers: Focus on methodology, findings, conclusions
    - Business reports: Emphasize metrics, strategy, performance
    - Legal documents: Highlight terms, obligations, compliance

    Document Context: {context}"""
```

Benefits:

* More relevant and targeted responses
* Better understanding of document-specific terminology
* Improved accuracy for domain-specific questions

2. Progressive Context Building

Strategy: Use document chunks with relevance scoring to build optimal context

Approach:

* Retrieve top 3–5 most relevant text chunks
* Combine with document metadata (type, key terms)
* Provide context hierarchy (most relevant first)
* Include similarity scores for transparency

Example:

```
context_parts = []
for chunk in similar_chunks:
    context_parts.append(
        f"[From {chunk['filename']} - Relevance: {chunk['similarity_score']:.3f}]\n"
        f"{chunk['text']}\n"
    )
```

3. Response Formatting Guidelines

Strategy: Structured prompts for consistent, professional output formatting

Implementation:

* Request specific formatting (headers, bullet points, sections)
* Ask for source references and confidence indicators
* Include follow-up question generation
* Specify response length and detail level

4. Error Handling and Fallbacks

Strategy: Graceful degradation when context is insufficient or API fails

Fallback Hierarchy:

1. Full API response with complete context
2. Partial response with limited context
3. Demo mode with pattern-based analysis
4. Error message with helpful suggestions

**Implementation Details**

Code Quality Measures

Documentation:

* Comprehensive docstrings for all functions
* Inline comments explaining complex logic
* Type hints for better code clarity
* README with clear setup instructions

Error Handling:

```
try:
    result = self.process_pdf(uploaded_file)
    if not result:
        st.error("Failed to process PDF. Please try a different file.")
        return False
except Exception as e:
    st.error(f"Error processing document: {str(e)}")
    return False
```

Performance Optimization:

* Streamlit caching for model loading: @st.cache\_resource
* Efficient text processing with regex optimization
* Minimal API calls through intelligent caching
* Progressive loading with user feedback

Testing Strategy

Manual Testing Conducted:

* Document Variety: Tested with research papers, business reports, technical manuals
* Size Testing: Documents from 1 page to 100+ pages

* UI Testing: Different screen sizes, mobile responsiveness

Edge Cases Handled:

* Empty or text-less PDFs
* Extremely large documents (memory management)
* API failures and rate limiting
* Network connectivity issues
* Invalid file formats
